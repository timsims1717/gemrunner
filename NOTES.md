# Jumping

* Can't jump from ladders
* Can't jump if there is a block above you
* Two kinds of jumps:
  * "long jump" that crosses 1 wide gaps
  * "high" jump that goes up one block and over in the direction facing
* If there are blocks up/right and up/left, high jump
* If there is a block left or right (when facing that way), high jump
* Otherwise, long jump
